#Basic list lab
#create a list, replace values, del values

hat_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # This is an existing list of numbers hidden in the hat.

# Step 1: write a line of code that prompts the user
# to replace the middle number with an integer number entered by the user.
user_choice = int(input("Replace the middle number with: "))
hat_list[2] = user_choice
print(hat_list)

# Step 2: write a line of code that removes the last element from the list.
del hat_list[4]
print(hat_list)
# Step 3: write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list.
print(len(hat_list))
print(hat_list)
