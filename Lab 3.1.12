#Calendar Lab to find whether a year is leap year or common year
#conditions are:
#if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
#otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
#otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
#otherwise, it's a leap year.
#warning if the year is anything before 1582 (Gregorian calendar introduced)

#defines a variable year with value input by the user assigned to it

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

#compares the variable year with 1582
#as soon as the year is anything before 1582
#it displays the above result and stops executing further
#if a valid year is entered, i.e. result is False, goes to the else condition

if year < 1582:
	print("Not within the Gregorian calendar period")

#condition one
#not divisible by 4
#i.e. there is some remainder (rem != 0)

else:
    if year % 4 != 0:
        print("Common year.")

#condition two
#not divisible by 100
#i.e. there is some remainder (rem != 0)

    elif year % 100 != 0:
        print("Leap year.")

#condition three
#not divisible by 400
#i.e. there is some remainder (rem != 0)

    elif year % 400 != 0:
        print("Common year.")

#if none of the above match, goes to the else condition below
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
