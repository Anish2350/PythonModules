kilometers = 12.25
miles = 7.38

miles_to_kilometers = miles * 1.61  #1 mile = 1.6km, so you multiply the mile by 1.61 to convert into km
kilometers_to_miles = kilometers / 1.61 #similarly, 1.6km = 1 mile, or 1km=1/1.61 miles; hence you divide by 1.61

print(miles, "miles is", round(miles_to_kilometers, 2), "kilometers") #miles here is variable, 'miles is' is string, round function rounds the result to 2 decimals after the point
print(kilometers, "kilometers is", round(kilometers_to_miles, 2), "miles")

#1 Euro is equivalent roughly to 0.84 Pounds

Pounds = 55.55
Euros = 87.0

pound_to_euro = Pounds / 0.84 #0.84 Pounds = 1 Euro, so 1 Pound = 1/0.84 Euros
euro_to_pound = Euros * 0.84 #1 Euro = 0.84 Pounds, so multiply by 0.84

print (Pounds, "Pounds is", round(pound_to_euro, 2), "in Euros.") #print function is used to invoke / call to display
print (Euros, "Euros is", round(euro_to_pound, 2), "in Pounds.")
