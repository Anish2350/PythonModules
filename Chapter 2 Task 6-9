#Practice1

print("Tell me anything...") #this invokes the print function to display the argument
anything = input() #this converts the console to input mode to allow user to input data, which is saved as a variable called 'anything'
print("Hmm...", anything, "... Really?") #invokes the print function to display the arguments, value from the variable 'anything' and another argument

#Practice2
anything = float(input("Enter a number: ")) #first converts the number you enter as a string then converts to a float. So it doesn't matter if you first enter an integer or a float e.g. 2 or 2.0 both would work
something = anything ** 2.0
print(anything, "to the power of 2 is", something)

#Practice3
leg_a = float(input("Input first leg length: ")) #same as above: treats as a string then converts to a float
leg_b = float(input("Input second leg length: "))
hypo = (leg_a**2 + leg_b**2) ** .5
print("Hypotenuse length is", hypo) #you can also remove the variable hypo and type the actual formula here instead


#Task 6-9
a = float(input("Let us assume the value of a is: ")) #data input by user is stored as variable 'a'
b = float(input("And the value of b is: ")) #data input by use is stored as variable 'b'
add = a + b #variable add is created that adds the above variables
subtract_ab = a - b
subtract_ba = b - a
print("When a and b are added together, a + b = ", add, ".")
print("When b is subtracted from a, a - b = ", subtract_ab, ".")
print("When a is subtracted from b, b - a = ", subtract_ba, ".")
print("When a and b are multiplied together, a * b = ", a * b, ".")
print("When a is divided by b, a / b = ", a / b, ".")
print("\nThat's all, folks!") #\n presents this display on next line
